# Neural CSSR: Bridging Classical Computational Mechanics with Modern Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This research project represents a synthesis of classical computational mechanics theory with modern deep learning approaches, aimed at discovering minimal causal representations in dynamical systems. The central question: **"What is the minimal information we need to predict a system's future behavior?"**

## Core Documents and Their Contributions

### 1. Neural CSSR Proposal (`neural_cssr.md`)
**Innovation**: Enhances classical Causal-State Splitting Reconstruction (CSSR) by replacing count-based probability estimation with neural networks (transformers).

**Key breakthrough**: Achieves exponentially better sample efficiency while preserving theoretical guarantees for discovering minimal sufficient statistics.

### 2. "Enumerating Finitary Processes" (Santa Fe Institute)
**Contribution**: Systematic enumeration of all possible topological ε-machines up to certain sizes, creating a "periodic table" of dynamical processes.

**Results**: Complete catalog of finite-memory processes (e.g., 1,993,473,480 binary 8-state machines).

### 3. "Discovering Governing Equations from Partial Measurements" 
**Approach**: Deep delay autoencoders that learn coordinate transformations from time-delay embeddings to discover sparse, interpretable dynamics.

**Connection**: Demonstrates how neural networks can discover dynamics from incomplete observations.

### 4. "What Is a Macrostate?" (Shalizi & Moore)
**Theoretical foundation**: Resolves the tension between subjective observations and objective dynamics in defining macrostates.

**Key insight**: Good macrostates are those that predict their own future (are Markovian).

### 5. "Every Good Regulator..." (Conant & Ashby)
**Fundamental theorem**: Any optimal regulator must be a model of the system it regulates.

**Implication**: Model-making is mathematically necessary, not optional.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Causal States and ε-Machines

**Causal State Definition**: Two histories belong to the same causal state if and only if:
```
P(Future | History₁) = P(Future | History₂)
```

**ε-Machine Properties**:
- Provably minimal sufficient statistics for prediction
- Markovian dynamics (future depends only on current causal state)
- Optimal information compression for prediction

### Topological ε-Machines

**Definition**: ε-machines where transition probabilities from each state are uniform across outgoing edges.

**Advantages**:
- Focus on structural relationships rather than specific probabilities
- Enables systematic enumeration (discrete vs. continuous parameter space)
- Represents canonical forms of equivalence classes

**Example**: If state A has 3 outgoing transitions, each has probability 1/3.

### The Sample Complexity Problem

**Classical CSSR bottleneck**:
- Requires exact string matches for probability estimation
- Needs O(k^L) samples for alphabet size k and history length L
- Cannot generalize between similar patterns

**Neural CSSR solution**:
- Uses transformer generalization: P_θ(X_{t+1} | history) ≈ P(X_{t+1} | history)
- Achieves O(N) sample complexity through pattern generalization
- Maintains theoretical optimality guarantees

## Neural CSSR Architecture and Approach

### Two-Phase Methodology

**Phase 1: Neural Probability Estimation**
```python
def neural_cssr(data, transformer, L_max, alpha):
    # Train transformer as standard autoregressive language model
    transformer.train(data)
    
    # Use transformer for CSSR probability estimation (preserves classical algorithm)
    states = classical_cssr_algorithm_with_neural_probabilities(data, transformer)
    
    return states
```

**Phase 2: Causal State Extraction**
```python
# Train linear probe to map transformer hidden states → discovered causal states
linear_probe = train_mapping(transformer_hidden_states, discovered_causal_states)
```

### Key Innovations

1. **Preserved Theoretical Guarantees**: Classical CSSR clustering algorithm unchanged
2. **Sample Efficiency**: Neural generalization replaces counting
3. **Self-Supervised Refinement**: Generate synthetic data from discovered ε-machine to improve training
4. **Principled OOD Detection**: Linear probe uncertainty indicates deviation from learned structure

### Autoregressive Perspective

ε-machines are autoregressive models where:
- Current output depends on entire past history
- Dependence is mediated through optimal finite-state representation
- Variable-length memory (adaptive window based on causal state)
- Represents theoretically optimal autoregressive architecture

## Dataset Construction from Enumeration

### Strategy: Complete Ground Truth Training

**Dataset Structure**:
```python
training_example = {
    # Input (what transformer sees)
    'history': [0, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    'target_next_token': 0,
    
    # Ground truth labels
    'true_causal_state': 'A',
    'true_machine_id': 42,
    'true_emission_prob': 0.5,
    
    # Machine properties
    'statistical_complexity': 1.58,
    'num_states': 3,
    'alphabet_size': 2,
}
```

**Multi-Level Organization**:
1. **Machine families** grouped by complexity (2-state, 3-state, etc.)
2. **Individual machines** with complete structural information
3. **Training sequences** with causal state annotations

### Training Methodology

**Curriculum Learning**:
- Start with simple 2-state binary machines
- Gradually increase complexity (more states, larger alphabets)
- Systematic progression maintains theoretical grounding

**Multi-Task Learning**:
```python
total_loss = autoregressive_loss + α * causal_state_loss + β * probability_estimation_loss
```

**Validation Strategy**:
- Train on subset of enumerated machines
- Test on completely held-out machine families
- Measure both prediction accuracy and structure recovery

### Advantages of Enumeration-Based Dataset

1. **Complete Ground Truth**: Exact causal states for every sequence position
2. **Systematic Coverage**: All possible structures up to enumeration limit
3. **Theoretical Validation**: Perfect labels enable rigorous testing
4. **Balanced Representation**: Controlled exposure across complexity levels

## Learning Objectives and Success Criteria

### What the Transformer Must Learn

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify similar predictive patterns across different machines
2. **Structure Invariance**: Recognize that structure matters more than specific symbols
3. **Complexity Scaling**: Handle increasing memory requirements gracefully
4. **Generalization**: Apply learned patterns to unseen machine types

### Success Metrics

1. **Perfect Recovery**: 95%+ accuracy on held-out enumerated machines
2. **Sample Efficiency**: Work with thousands, not millions of samples
3. **Structure Generalization**: Discover correct states for novel machine types
4. **Theoretical Consistency**: Match optimality criteria from classical theory

## Theoretical Connections and Implications

### Information-Theoretic Guarantees

**Key theorem**: For any sufficient statistic η and minimal sufficient statistic ε:
```
There exists deterministic function f such that ε = f(η)
```

**Translation**: Neural network hidden states contain sufficient information; causal states can be extracted via learned mapping.

### Regulatory Perspective

**Conant-Ashby connection**: Optimal prediction requires internal modeling of the process structure. Neural CSSR discovers these necessary internal models.

### Macrostate Resolution

**Shalizi-Moore insight**: Neural CSSR implements the objective refinement process from subjective observables to optimal predictive states.

## Implementation Considerations

### Architecture Choices

**Transformer Configuration**:
- Standard autoregressive transformer for probability estimation
- Linear probes for causal state extraction
- Multi-head attention for pattern recognition across time scales

**Training Regimen**:
- Phase 1: Standard language modeling on multi-machine dataset
- Phase 2: Supervised causal state extraction
- Optional: Self-supervised refinement with synthetic data generation

### Computational Complexity

**Classical CSSR**: O(k^L) sample complexity, exponential in history length
**Neural CSSR**: O(N) sample complexity, polynomial in dataset size

**Trade-off**: Upfront neural training cost for exponential improvement in discovery efficiency
