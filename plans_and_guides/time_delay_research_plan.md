# Time-Delay Embeddings vs Standard Transformers: Anti-Shortcut Causal Structure Discovery Research Plan

## Executive Summary

This research investigates whether time-delay embeddings force transformers to learn causal state structure rather than relying on marginal distribution shortcuts. We design anti-shortcut datasets where marginal learning fails but causal structure learning succeeds, then extract explicit ε-machines from both architectures using four complementary mechanisms.

**Core Hypothesis:** Time-delay embeddings architecturally constrain transformers to discover causal states, while standard transformers can exploit marginal shortcuts.

**Key Innovation:** Bridge continuous neural representations to discrete ε-machines for direct comparison with classical CSSR using existing computational mechanics tools.

## 1. Research Background & Motivation

### 1.1 The Marginal vs Causal Learning Problem

**Standard Transformers Can Learn Shortcuts:**
```python
# Shortcut learning (marginal statistics):
P(next_token) = 0.5  # Just memorize overall 50/50 distribution

# True causal learning:
P(next_token | causal_state_A) = 0.8  # State A strongly prefers 1
P(next_token | causal_state_B) = 0.2  # State B strongly prefers 0
```

**Why This Matters:**
- In complex domains (language), marginal distributions are already complex
- But for controlled scientific domains, marginal shortcuts prevent discovery of underlying structure
- Need to test whether architectural constraints force causal learning

### 1.2 Time-Delay Embedding Hypothesis

**Claim:** Time-delay embeddings force causal learning because:
1. **Identical delay patterns** must produce **identical predictions** (architectural constraint)
2. **Different causal states** have **different delay pattern signatures**
3. **Marginal learning becomes impossible** due to structured temporal dependencies

**Test Strategy:** Create datasets where this constraint matters and measure the difference.

## 2. Experimental Design Overview

### 2.1 Research Questions

1. **Primary:** Do time-delay embeddings force causal structure discovery vs marginal shortcuts?
2. **Secondary:** Which machine extraction mechanism best captures learned structure?
3. **Comparative:** How do neural approaches compare to classical CSSR?
4. **Mechanistic:** What representations do transformers actually learn?

### 2.3 Success Metrics

**If Time-Delay Hypothesis is Correct:**
- Time-delay model: Performance gap > 0.20, Causal ARI > 0.6, High context dependency
- Standard model: Performance gap < 0.10, Poor state structure, Low context dependency
- Consistent machine extraction across all 4 mechanisms for time-delay
- Time-delay extracted machines closer to ground truth than standard

## 3. Anti-Shortcut Dataset Generation

### 3.1 Design Principles

**Create machines where marginal learning fails but causal learning succeeds:**

1. **Extreme State Divergence:** Each causal state has very different emission probabilities
2. **Balanced Overall Marginals:** Despite state-specific bias, overall distribution appears uniform  
3. **Long Memory Dependencies:** Current state depends on distant history
4. **Complex Transition Structure:** Not easily predictable from short contexts

### 3.2 Specific Dataset Configurations

**Configuration 1: Extreme Divergence**
```yaml
machine_specs:
  - complexity_class: "2-state-binary"
    custom_probabilities:
      "S0": {"0": 0.95, "1": 0.05}  # Extreme bias toward '0'
      "S1": {"0": 0.05, "1": 0.95}  # Extreme bias toward '1'
  
  - complexity_class: "3-state-binary"  
    custom_probabilities:
      "S0": {"0": 0.9, "1": 0.1}    # Strong bias toward '0'
      "S1": {"0": 0.1, "1": 0.9}    # Strong bias toward '1'  
      "S2": {"0": 0.5, "1": 0.5}    # Balanced (but rare state)

sequence_spec:
  length_distribution: [100, 500]  # Long sequences for memory dependencies
  total_sequences: 7000
```

**Configuration 2: Deceptive Marginals**
- Multiple machines with same marginal (~50/50) but different causal structure
- High complexity machines (4-7 states) with subtle differences
- Very long sequences (300-1500 tokens) for complex temporal dependencies

### 3.3 Expected Anti-Shortcut Properties

**Statistical Indicators:**
- High statistical complexity (> 1.5 bits)
- Low marginal predictability (n-gram baselines < 55% accuracy)
- High Bayes optimal gap (> 20% difference from marginal baseline)

**Quality Validation:**
- Balanced marginals (≈ [0.5, 0.5]) despite state biases
- High state divergence (JS divergence between states > 0.3)
- Long memory requirement (conditional entropy decreases with context length)

## 4. Model Architectures

### 4.1 Standard Transformer (Baseline)

```python
class StandardTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size=4, d_model=256, n_heads=8, n_layers=4):
        super().__init__()
        # Standard token embeddings + positional encoding
        self.token_embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model)
        self.position_embedding = nn.Embedding(max_seq_len, d_model)
        
        # Standard transformer encoder with causal masking
        encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(...)
        self.transformer = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, n_layers)
        
        # Prediction head
        self.prediction_head = nn.Linear(d_model, 2)  # Binary output
```

### 4.2 Time-Delay Transformer (Hypothesis)

```python
class TimeDelayTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size=4, max_delay=10, d_model=256, n_heads=8, n_layers=4):
        super().__init__()
        # Time-delay embedding (key innovation)
        self.delay_embedding = TimeDelayEmbedding(vocab_size, max_delay, d_model)
        
        # Standard transformer encoder (processes delay-embedded space)
        encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(...)
        self.transformer_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, n_layers)
        
        # Prediction head
        self.prediction_head = nn.Linear(d_model, 2)
        
    def forward(self, sequences):
        # Create time-delay embeddings: [x_{t-max_delay}, ..., x_{t-1}, x_t]
        delay_embedded = self.delay_embedding(sequences)
        hidden_states = self.transformer_encoder(delay_embedded)
        logits = self.prediction_head(hidden_states)
        return logits
```

**Key Innovation:** Time-delay embedding creates architectural constraint that identical delay patterns must produce identical predictions.

## 5. Machine Extraction Mechanisms

### 5.1 Four Complementary Approaches

Transform continuous neural representations → discrete ε-machines:

**Mechanism 1: Hidden State Clustering**
- Directly cluster transformer hidden representations
- Each cluster = discrete state in extracted machine
- Captures: Internal representation structure

**Mechanism 2: Neural CSSR**  
- Use transformer for probability estimation in classical CSSR algorithm
- Preserves theoretical guarantees while using neural generalization
- Captures: Theoretically optimal causal structure

**Mechanism 3: Linear Probe Extraction**
- Train classifier: hidden_state → ground_truth_causal_state
- Requires ground truth labels for supervision
- Captures: Alignment with known causal structure

**Mechanism 4: Symbolic Abstraction**
- Use decision trees to find interpretable rules in representation space
- Each leaf node = discrete state
- Captures: Human-interpretable decision boundaries

### 5.2 Extraction Process Details

```python
# For each mechanism:
continuous_representations = extract_from_transformer(model, dataset)
discrete_states = apply_extraction_mechanism(representations)
explicit_machine = build_epsilon_machine(discrete_states)

# Result: Explicit ε-machine with:
epsilon_machine = {
    'states': [0, 1, 2, 3],
    'transitions': {0: {'0': 1, '1': 2}, 1: {'0': 0, '1': 3}, ...},
    'emissions': {0: {'0': 0.8, '1': 0.2}, 1: {'0': 0.1, '1': 0.9}, ...},
    'alphabet': ['0', '1']
}
```

### 5.3 Integration with Existing Analysis

**Leverage Existing MachineDistanceCalculator:**
- State mapping distance (Hungarian algorithm + JS divergence)
- Transition structure distance (graph-based metrics)  
- Symbol distribution distance (emission probability comparison)

**Direct Comparison Capability:**
```python
distance_calculator = MachineDistanceCalculator()
results = distance_calculator.compare_all([
    standard_extracted_machine,
    time_delay_extracted_machine, 
    classical_cssr_machine,
    ground_truth_machine
])
```

## 6. Anti-Shortcut Analysis Framework

### 6.1 Core Tests

**Test 1: Marginal vs Causal Performance**
```python
marginal_baseline = 0.5  # For balanced binary data
model_accuracy = ?       # Should be much higher if learning causal structure
performance_gap = model_accuracy - marginal_baseline  # KEY METRIC
```

**Test 2: Representation Clustering Analysis**  
```python
causal_ari_score = adjusted_rand_score(true_labels, discovered_clusters)
state_separation_ratio = between_state_distance / within_state_distance
```

**Test 3: Context Dependency Analysis**
```python
context_improvement = long_context_accuracy - short_context_accuracy
# Should be high if model requires full history for good predictions
```

**Test 4: Linear Separability of States**
```python
probe_accuracy = linear_classifier.score(hidden_states, true_causal_states)
# Should be high if representations are well-structured by causal states
```

### 6.2 Comprehensive Assessment

**Overall Score Calculation:**
```python
performance_score = min(performance_gap * 5, 1.0)  
structure_score = (causal_ari + separation_ratio/3 + context_improvement*5 + probe_accuracy) / 4
overall_score = (performance_score + structure_score) / 2

# Interpretation:
# > 0.7: Strong evidence of causal structure learning
# 0.4-0.7: Moderate causal structure learning  
# < 0.4: Likely relying on marginal shortcuts
```

## Conclusion

This research plan provides a definitive test of whether architectural constraints (time-delay embeddings) can force causal structure discovery in transformers. By combining anti-shortcut dataset design, multiple machine extraction mechanisms, and existing computational mechanics analysis tools, we can bridge neural representations to discrete ε-machines for direct comparison.

The plan leverages substantial existing infrastructure while adding focused innovations to address a fundamental question about inductive biases in neural architecture design. Success will advance both machine learning methodology and computational mechanics theory, providing practical guidance for designing architectures that discover rather than shortcut underlying causal structure.
